The codes serve the published paper Transforming public transport depots into profitable energy hubs (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01580-0). 

1. The GPS data processing code was executed on a computer running Python 3.8. The package versions used are Pandas 1.3.5 and joblib 1.1.1.
2. This code was employed to label the states of vehicle movement and stopping, specifically identifying when a vehicle is stationary at a depot.
3. After processing the GPS data, the results are utilized to calculate vehicle energy consumption and the available charging time.
